  <p>If you have an underweight Body Mass Index (BMI), there are several things you can do to improve your BMI:</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>1.Consult with a healthcare professional: Before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional such as a doctor or a dietitian. They can help you determine the best course of action for your specific needs.</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>2.Increase calorie intake: To increase your BMI, you'll need to consume more calories than you burn. This can be done by eating more nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>3.Consume adequate protein: Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue. Aim for at least 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day.</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>4.Include healthy fats in your diet: Healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds, are calorie-dense and can help you reach your calorie goals.</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>5.Use supplements: If you're having trouble getting enough nutrients from food alone, supplements such as protein powder, weight gainer, or a multivitamin may be helpful.</p>
  
  <span>
    <pre>


    </pre>
  </span>
  <p>6.Exercise: Exercise can help you to build muscle and increase your overall calorie expenditure. Talk to your healthcare professional to help design a safe workout plan that's right for you.
</p>

<span>
  <pre>


  </pre>
</span>
<p>7.Be patient: Gaining weight takes time, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't see results right away.</p>

<span>
  <pre>


  </pre>
</span>
<p>8.Stay consistent: Stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine and make adjustments as needed.</p>

<span>
  <pre>


  </pre>
</span>
<p>9.It's important to keep in mind that weight gain should be gradual and healthy, and it's not about gaining weight as fast as possible. Crash dieting or over-exercising can lead to negative consequences.</p>

<span>
  <pre>


  </pre>
</span>
<p>10.Also, it's important to note that a healthy weight gain is not only about increasing muscle mass but also about increasing bone density and overall health.</p>
